Here we have a simple pendulum that swings with time, without any friction. Then we have two double pendulums. A double pendulum is defined as chaotic, because it is very sensitive to initial conditions. To give an example, the two pendulums start the simulation with 1 degree of difference, it's almost imperceptible to the eye, but after 30 seconds of simulation, they start to separate from each other to finally have a completely different oscillation.",
