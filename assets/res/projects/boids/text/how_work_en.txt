The basic flocking model consists of three simple steering behaviors which describe how an individual boid maneuvers based on the positions and velocities its nearby flockmates.
<ul>
    <li> separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates. </li>
    <li> alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates. </li>
    <li> cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates. </li>
</ul>
