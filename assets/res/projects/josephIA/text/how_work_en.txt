JosephIA is based on the minimax algorithm optimized with alpha-beta pruning.
Minimax algorithm calculate the minimax decision at a current state and try to find the optimal move for a player, assuming that your opponent also plays optimally. It use a backtracking-like method, doing a simple recursive call developping all leaf of the tree, pushing up these values level by level. Minimax explore (DFS Depth First Search) the tree.

In 1956, John McCarthy is presiding Dartmouth's conference, in which he presents alpha-beta prunning, that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision.
