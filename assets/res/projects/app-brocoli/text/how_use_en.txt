You must have on your machine:
<ul>
    <li>PHP version 7 or higher</li>
    <li>A web server (Apache)</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
</ul>
<br>
The site has its own database that you need to load in order to make it functional.
<br>
After going to the root of the site, go to your mysql terminal and run the following command:
<span class="code">SOURCE sql/bdd.sql;</span>
<br>
Everything is included in this file, but if you want to change the login, you can change the constants in the php/constant.php file.
<br>
At the root of the project, run the following command:
<span class="code">sudo chmod 777 file/downloadFic </span>
<br>
This allows the site to create files in this directory. If the directory does not exist, you must create it with the following command:
<span class="code">sudo mkdir file/downloadFic </span>
