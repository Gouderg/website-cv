The site was developed in several stages:
<ul>
    <li>Layout of the site</li>
    <li>Creation of the database</li>
    <li>Creation of the API with Symfony</li>
    <li>Creation of the administrator part that can manage the databases with Symfony</li>
    <li>Creation of the user interface with React</li>
</ul>
<br>
The user interface has 2 pages:
<ul>
    <li>The first one allows to calculate decompression stops and other data related to diving according to some data</li>
    <li>The second one allows to look at the decompression stops of the MN90 or Bullman table.</li>
</ul>
<br>     
The website also has an admin interface. However, you have to connect on a different URL because the admin part is on the symfony server.
There is a login page requiring a user and a password. The admin side allows to add / modify / delete in the database.
