The Game of Life is a two-dimensional grid of white (dead cells) and black (living cells) cells. The program is based on the following rules:
A dead cell with exactly three living neighbours becomes alive (it is born).
A living cell with two or three living neighbours stays alive, otherwise it dies.

The application of these two rules will give an infinite number of combinations such as
<ul>
    <li> Oscillators: these are forms that after x generations return to their original form. </li>
    <li> Vessels: these are shapes that cross the grid. </li>
    <li> Cannons: these are shapes that create infinite projectiles. </li>
</ul>
There are also stable shapes, i.e. shapes that do not move over time.
My programme has a donut formation, which means that if a cell disappears on the right of the screen, it reappears on the left of the screen and if a cell disappears on the top of the screen, it reappears on the bottom of the screen.
