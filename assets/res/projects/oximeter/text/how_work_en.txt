First, we need to retrieve a valid 21-bit frame and until we have a valid frame, we continue to collect the frame.
After fetching the frame, we have 4 values:
<ul>
    <li> AC R: the peak to peak variation of the measured red light. (pulse wave) </li>
    <li> DC R: the average value of the measured red light. (tissue) </li>
    <li> AC IR: the peak-to-peak variation of the measured infrared light. (pulse wave) </li>
    <li> DC IR: the average value of the measured infrared light. (tissue) </li>
</ul>

Next, a finite response filter (FIR) is applied to filter out the high frequency components of the signals and keep the frequencies around 1 kHz.
After FIR filtering, the resulting AC components are then processed by means of an infinite response filter (IIR). This filter is used to remove the resulting DC component. DC component.

Finally, the SP02 and the heart rate are calculated.
