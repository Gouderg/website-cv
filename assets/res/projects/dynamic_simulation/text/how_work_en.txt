In physics, the simple pendulum is a point mass attached to the end of a massless, inextensible wire and swinging under the influence of gravity. It is the simplest model of a weighing pendulum. It is sometimes called an ideal gravity pendulum and, in contrast, any real gravity pendulum is called a compound gravity pendulum. By extension, a device in which the inextensible wire is replaced by a rigid rod of zero mass that can rotate without friction in a vertical plane around its fixed end (perfect linkage) is also sometimes called a simple pendulum.
In mechanics, a double pendulum is a pendulum to which another pendulum is attached. Its evolution is generally chaotic. The theory of chaos in itself corresponds to the study of the behaviour of dynamic systems, which are particularly sensitive to the initial conditions imposed on them.
The acceleration equation of the double pendulum is a little longer:
