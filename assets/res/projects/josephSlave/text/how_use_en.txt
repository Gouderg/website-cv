To be able to use the bot, you need to install the following packages: npm, curl, nodejs, ffmpeg
With npm, you have to install the following packages: discord.js, node-opus, youtube-audio-stream, xmlhttprequest

Then you have to create a config.json file with the following structure:

{
"token" : "insert_token",
	"cleNasa" : "insert_token",
	"cleOpenWeather" : "insert_token",
	"cleJoke" : "insert_token"
}

Finally, we need to launch the bot with the following command:
<span class="code">node index.js</span>
